# GIAP — convenience targets.
#
# The primary interface is the menu-driven control script:
#
#     bash scripts/giap.sh            # install, build, service, logs, doctor
#     bash scripts/giap.sh doctor     # non-interactive health check, exit 1 on FAIL
#
# It detects the host (Jetson / Linux / macOS) and whether CUDA is usable, and
# picks the right feature flags. This Makefile only forwards to it.
#
# Jetson-specific verbs live in scripts/jetson.sh (deploy | build | docker-build
# | optimize | probe-mlc).
#
# The old cross-compilation targets were removed. They did not work for the path
# that matters: nvcc has to target the device architecture, so a CUDA build must
# happen ON the Jetson. They also referenced scripts/build-jetson-native.sh,
# which does not exist, and deployed to a host and directory that no longer do
# either. Use `make deploy` below, which routes through the real deploy script.
