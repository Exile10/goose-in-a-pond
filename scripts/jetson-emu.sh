# ── What this is ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The Jetson-specific behaviour in this workspace is a handful of independent
# reads — /proc/device-tree/model, /etc/nv_tegra_release, a RAM constant, and a
# cargo feature — and none of them is true on a MacBook. The consequence is not
# that the Mac behaves a little differently. It is that whole branches are
# UNREACHABLE there:
#
#   LocalInferenceLlmAdapter::apply_jetson_settings is #[cfg(feature = "cuda")],
#   so jetson_context_size — the arithmetic that can OOM the board — had unit
#   tests for its answer and no caller on any machine a developer can run.
#
# This runs those branches on the Mac. See
# crates/pond-core/src/models/domain/device_profile.rs.
#
# ── What this is NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# It emulates what the board DECIDES, never what the board SURVIVES.
#
#   * Tier 1 cannot enforce a memory ceiling. macOS has no cgroups; a 64 GB Mac
#     will not run out of memory at 7,620 MB however convincingly it reports it.
#   * NO TIER is a source of a performance or KV-cost number. The Mac has
#     already reported a THIRD of the device's real per-token KV cost for the
#     same model, and a commit that believed it was wrong. Throughput, TTFT,
#     KV cost, NvMap behaviour and live free memory come from the Orin.
#   * Neither tier has CUDA. Tier 2 is a generic arm64 container with no JetPack.
#
# `doctor` prints this table with the specific call sites. Read it once.

# not, so that its table stays exactly parallel to DeviceProfile::builtin_names.
